<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

The project title should be self-explanatory and try not to make it a mouthful. (Although exceptions exist- **awesome-readme-writing-guide-for-open-source-projects** - would have been a cool name)

# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.

# Table of contents

After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README.
